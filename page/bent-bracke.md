I'm a webdeveloper currently living in Denmark. My main focus is on extending the functionality of internet and intranet systems. I have extensive experience with creating such extensions, both in the form of web services, libraries, usercontrols and webparts.

## Short bio
I was born in Flensburg, Germany and I have lived there for 20 years. I later moved to Aarhus in Denmark in order to study Physics and IT. Later I decided to focus on IT. I got my degree and I now work in small IT firm as a webdeveloper.
