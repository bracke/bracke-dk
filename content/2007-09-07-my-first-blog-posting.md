So this is it, I have a blog! This is the first post to my blog, well actually the first was a test posting but that doesn&#8217;t count!

<!--more-->
I chose to have a blog because I wanted to try something different than I usually do. I&#8217;m a web developer, I usually create the infra structure / code of websites, not the content. With this blog Google delivers the infrastructure and I deliver the content (are you bored yet?) .

Anyway, I figure I&#8217;m going to talk about what interests me, which is the web in general and web development in particular, but also about music, books and most importantly the movies and TV series I watch.
It will  likely not interest anyone, but maybe my written English will improve and perhaps I will have had some fun, ranting about random things on my mind.
