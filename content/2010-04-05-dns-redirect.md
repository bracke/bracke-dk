My Squarespace address is bbracke.squarespace.com which is neither good nor really bad. I have another address www.bracke.dk which is better and the obvious solution would be to perform a DNS redirect but the basic Squarespace account does not support that.


## DNS redirection and SquareSpace Pro

Well, now I have upgraded my Squarespace to &#8216;Pro&#8217; which supports DNS redirection. With the help of the free DNS service <a rel="external" href="http://www.gratisdns.dk">gratisdns.dk</a> and a few changed settings in the Squarespace setup, I performed the redirect. Now bracke.dk and www.bracke.dk both point to bbracke.squarespace.com.
